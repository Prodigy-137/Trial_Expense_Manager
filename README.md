NEURAL FINANCE • PRO
A Futuristic Financial Management Suite

Welcome to Neural Finance Pro! This isn't just a simple spreadsheet; it is a high-performance, automated personal finance tool designed with a futuristic interface to help you master your money.

**HOW TO START**
Launch: Double-click the main.exe file (or run python main.py if using source code).
First Run: On your first launch, the system will automatically create data.json and settings.json in your folder. This is where your data is stored securely and locally.
Customize: Head over to the Settings tab immediately to set your preferred Currency and add your personal Expense Categories.

**KEY FEATURES**
 _Neural Dashboard:_ A real-time overview of your monthly finances. It features high-contrast "Hero Cards" for income/expenses and a dynamic "Expense Allocation" pie chart.
 _Intelligent Logger:_ Add transactions with precision. Includes a built-in Calendar Date Picker and a smart form that switches between dropdowns (for expenses) and manual text (for income).
 _Budget Thresholds:_ Set monthly limits for specific categories (e.g., Food, Travel). The dashboard shows color-coded progress bars:
Green: Safe.
Orange: Approaching limit (80%).
Red: Limit exceeded!
 _Automated Flows (Subscriptions):_ Perfect for Netflix, Rent, or Salary. Add a "Recurring" item once, and the app will automatically log it for you every month the moment you open the app.
 _Transaction Ledger: _A powerful history view. You can search by keywords, filter by category, or filter by transaction type to find exactly where your money went.
 _CSV Synchronization:_ Need your data in Excel? One click in the History tab exports your entire ledger into a professional CSV file.
**🛠 HOW TO USE THE WORKFLOW**__
_Setup Categories:_ Go to Settings and "Register" the categories you spend money on (e.g., Gaming, Groceries, Rent).
_Set Budgets:_ Go to Monthly Budgets, pick a category, and set a limit.
_Log Daily:_ Use the Add Transaction tab whenever you spend or earn. Use the calendar to back-date items if you forgot to log them yesterday.
_Monitor:_ Check the Dashboard frequently to see your spending pie chart and ensure your progress bars aren't turning red!
_Automate:_ Put your monthly bills in the Subscriptions tab so you never have to log them manually again.

 **DATA PRIVACY**
_Local Storage:_ Your financial data never leaves your computer. It is stored in data.json.
_Portability:_ If you want to move your data to a new computer, just copy the data.json and settings.json files along with the software.
